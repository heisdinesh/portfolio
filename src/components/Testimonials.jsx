              Dinesh is a gifted logo-designer with a rare combination of
              patience, creative, and research skills. Iâ€™m lucky to have worked
              with Dinesh, his initial designs were spot on in terms of matching
              our brief, and he was able to articulate clearly and concisely why
              he had included particular features of the logo, how they would
              work to achieve our goals and appeal to our target market.
